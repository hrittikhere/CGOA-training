# Certified GitOps Associate (CGOA)

Purpose: The purpose of the Certified GitOps Associate (CGOA) certification is to provide assurance that CGOAs can effectively demonstrate their understanding of GitOps principles, terminology, and best practices in setting up a GitOps managed software system in addition to related practices such as Configuration of Code, Infrastructure as Code, DevOps & DevSecOps, and CI & CD and how to map them to GitOps.

# Study Tips
- Play with the tools like ArgoCD a bit to understand them clearly
- Focus on implementing and running a simple GitOps Application for Clarity
- Learn a bit of Architecture of the Tools as it helps you remember theory for longer

# Exam Tips ( PSI ) 
- Keep your desk tidy and run the System Check before the exams.
-  Carry an ID that has not expired.
- The exam can be started 30 minutes prior to your scheduled time, which is an excellent opportunity to complete the security checks and begin the exam early. It helps me to calm down and not rush during the exam :) 
- Delete the PSI Browser from your system to save time for your next exam. 
- Mark the questions `To Review` if you need more clarification and want to get back later. You have a dashboard with all the questions collectively listed, which helps you to get back to easily
